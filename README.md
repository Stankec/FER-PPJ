# PPJ

This repository holds our team's solution for the course "Prevodenje Programskih Jezika" (eng. "Translation of Programming Languages")

## Running

Examples for each individual part of the compiler can be run by executing the following scripts:

* `run-examples` - Runs the lexic analyzer examples
* `run-examples-sa` - Runs the syntax analyzer examples
* `run-examples-sem` - Runs the semantic analyzer examples

Output from the one feeds into the other as this is intended to be run on our facultie's code runner SPRUT.
